I am feeling stressed about {stressor}.

Guide my thought process through a sequence of questions and proposed answers, related to this stress. Please initiate the thought-provoking sequence of questions by asking me one question and only ask the next one when an answer is provided. With each question, provide several suggestions.

Ask how I’m contributing to this stress (for example excessive worrying, high expectations, unhealthy thought patterns, poor planning, etc.)
Challenge me to think about ways this could be reframed.
Acknowledge my response and suggest further re-framing questions.
Ask me what I’m doing or plan to do, to help reduce and recover from this stress.
Acknowledge my response and suggest further ways I might practice active or passive recovery.
Affirm my ability to get through it.

Throughout the sequence of questions, focus on facilitating my thought-processing for deciding next steps by asking follow-up questions and offering further suggestions when appropriate. The goal is to help me identify some meaningful next steps I can take to reframe, manage and recover from my stress.

The questions should be asked one at a time, only move onto the next question after I have replied.
